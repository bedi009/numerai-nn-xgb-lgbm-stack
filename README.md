[Numerai Tournament] State-of-the-art models comparison

This notebook provides a brief analysis of the most commonly used models, primarily tree-based regressors, and a feed-forward neural network in the context of the Numerai Tournament.
The code can serve as a basis for building more complex models. Future improvements to this ensemble model may include feature engineering and target ensemble.
